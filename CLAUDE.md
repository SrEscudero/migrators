### Analysis Summary

I can help you with that! What would you like to know about the codebase? Please provide me with a query. For example, you could ask:

*   "What is the overall architecture of the system?"
*   "How does the user authentication process work?"
*   "Show me the implementation of the `PaymentProcessor` class."
*   "Where are the database models defined?"

The more specific you are, the better I can assist you.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Overall System Purpose**
   The system is designed to answer user queries about a codebase. It acts as an interactive assistant, capable of providing information on various aspects of the codebase, from high-level architecture to specific implementation details. The core functionality revolves around processing user input and generating relevant, detailed responses.

2. **Processing User Queries**
   The system's primary interaction mechanism involves receiving a user query. This input is then processed to understand the user's intent and the specific information they are seeking about the codebase. The system is designed to be flexible, accommodating a wide range of questions.

3. **Generating Comprehensive Answers**
   Based on the processed query, the system formulates an answer. This answer can range from a general overview of the system's capabilities to specific details about components like `user authentication` or `PaymentProcessor` classes, or even the location of `database models`. The system aims to provide precise and helpful information.

4. **Facilitating Specific Information Retrieval**
   The system encourages users to provide specific queries to enhance the quality and relevance of the answers. This iterative interaction allows for a more focused and effective information retrieval process, ensuring the user gets the most accurate details about the codebase.
